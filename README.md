Brew-manity (Alt Ctrl Game)
Concept: A stroke of bad luck has left you marooned on a strange planet called Earth, but it’ll take more than luck if you’re to have any hope of getting off this rock! Work your way through hordes of aliens who have a craving for some sort of “kofvee”. Now you must master the art of the barista in a strange new body, scraping together all the coin you can get. At least they tip well! (It's a game where you make coffee with wacky arm movement.)

This game is a school project where we were challenged to develop an alt-ctrl game and an accompanying controller.

Our custom controller consists of a button, accelerometer, and vibration motor, all controlled by a teensyduino and embedded within a custom made silicone brain.

Contributions: I was in charge of doing the wiring and coding for our alt controller. Our final concept used an accelerometer for gyro controls and a button to replicate a key stroke. The controller also included vibration motors for haptic feedback such as a button push. At first I had somewhat of a difficult time relearning how to code for an arduino and also wire mechanics to a bread board. Over the span of the semester, I really learned a lot about the subject and even successfully soldered all the componets to a more condensed sized chip which integrated into our fabricated brain. 

Here are some progress pictures

Here is how the final controller fits into our fabricated brain

Overall, the process was very challenging, but rewarding. I believe our final project turned out very well and just how I imagined it when we first began brainstorming. The most challenging aspect for me was probably the accelerometer, simply due to the unfamiliarity with the technology and the sheer amount of data that the component can produce such as values, calibration, etc. Thankfully I figured it out early on into our first prototype so we could begin testing, and with time I was able to get it working consistently for our final product. When it came to the button, we originally had plans to use a large scale 4 inch arcade button. After receiving it from Amazon during our 2nd prototype, I quickly realized that it would not be able to fit into our fabricated brain due to its large size. It also made a very loud clicking noise when pressed which was something our group agreed would not be pleasant in our controller. Thankfully, our professor had a quality small arcade button (like one you would push on a pac-man machine) and it was the perfect size to be functional and quiet and sleek for implementing into our brain. Lastly, when it came to playtesting pushing the button didn't really provide any feedback when the action was made. Due to this I began working on a motorized vibration component that would provide haptic feedback to the player when pushing the button. Once wired, the vibration motor could sit snugly into a divit made in the silicone brain, providing optimal vibrations when activated.
